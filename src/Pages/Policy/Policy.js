        We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick,
         which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and 
         visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense 
         advertisements).

          The cookies is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests
          (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your
          previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about
          Samsung batteries, you may see Samsung batteries advertisements when viewing 
          a non-related site, such as on a site about medicine). DART uses “non-personally 
          identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, 
          such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social 
          security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out
            of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by 
            visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx

            You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or
            third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences 
            in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can 
            affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. 
            This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging 
            into forums or accounts.

            Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.
            Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running 
            the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
